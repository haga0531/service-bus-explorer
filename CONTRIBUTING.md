# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Run the application
dotnet run --project src/ServiceBusExplorer.UI
```

### Coding Standards

### Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ ServiceBusExplorer.Core/          # Business logic (no UI dependencies)
â”œâ”€â”€ ServiceBusExplorer.Infrastructure/ # External service integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ ServiceBusExplorer.UI/            # UI layer (Avalonia)
â””â”€â”€ ServiceBusExplorer.Tests/         # Unit tests
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for high code coverage
- Use meaningful test names that describe what is being tested

Example test structure:
```csharp
[Test]
public void MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior()
{
    // Arrange
    
    // Act
    
    // Assert
}
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
feat: Add message export functionality

- Add export to JSON and CSV formats
- Support bulk export operations
- Add progress reporting for large exports

Fixes #123
